/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/lightning/pytorch/trainer/connectors/logger_connector/logger_connector.py:76: Starting from v1.9.0, `tensorboardX` has been removed as a dependency of the `lightning.pytorch` package, due to potential conflicts with other packages in the ML ecosystem. For this reason, `logger=True` will use `CSVLogger` as the default logger, unless the `tensorboard` or `tensorboardX` packages are found. Please `pip install lightning[extra]` or one of them to enable TensorBoard support by default
💡 Tip: For seamless cloud logging and experiment tracking, try installing [litlogger](https://pypi.org/project/litlogger/) to enable LitLogger, which logs metrics and artifacts automatically to the Lightning Experiments platform.
💡 Tip: For seamless cloud uploads and versioning, try installing [litmodels](https://pypi.org/project/litmodels/) to enable LitModelCheckpoint, which syncs automatically with the Lightning model registry.
You are using a CUDA device ('NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090') that has Tensor Cores. To properly utilize them, you should set `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('medium' | 'high')` which will trade-off precision for performance. For more details, read https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.set_float32_matmul_precision.html#torch.set_float32_matmul_precision

/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/lightning/pytorch/trainer/connectors/data_connector.py:434: The 'predict_dataloader' does not have many workers which may be a bottleneck. Consider increasing the value of the `num_workers` argument` to `num_workers=95` in the `DataLoader` to improve performance.
